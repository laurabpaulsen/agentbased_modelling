# Agentbased_modelling

### Notes & ideas:
Investigating recruitment
* Vary what is taken into account
    * Does gender modulate the chance of getting promoted?
    * Is it modulated by who filled the position before?


Instead of simulating a company we could simulate the entire 'office-world' in Denmark? 





### Code to-do
[] What kind of data do we need to save as we go?
[X] Give weights in populate_company function rather than if statements in the function
