# Agentbased_modelling

### Code to-do

    [] Check why it seems as if the bias thing is not really working
    [] What kind of data do we need to save as we go?

    [] Should senority_position be 0 for randomly generated new agents at entry level?
    []] Fix promote agent so it takes senority position into account
    [] Figure out how many positions at each level
    [] Determine how many agents part way with the company at each level at each tick
    [] Does the company increase over time? i.e., get more positions?
    [] Include parental leave
    [] Number of employees taken into account when hiring (e.g short list)
    [] Bigger spread in ages from the beginning (goes crazy when everyone retires)
