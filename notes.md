### Code to-do
    [] Figure out how many positions at each level (emma is on it)
    [] Number of employees taken into account when hiring (e.g short list)
    [] Bigger spread in ages from the beginning (goes crazy when everyone retires)
        * rchunknorm like thing
    [] Determine how many agents part way with the company at each level at each tick (emma is also kinda on it)
    [] Should senority_position be 0 for randomly generated new agents at entry level?
    [] Determine how to calculate weights for promotion
        * seniority position, seniority, personality trait (NOT AGE)
        [] Do we want to add "abillities" trait to when generating agents (mean = zero, sd  = something)
    [] Ensure that some females has already been on parental leave (i.e, subtract something from seniority and seniority postion when populating company)



We do not include this: 
* "company" has the same size i.e., same number of positions does not increase

Assumptions:
* Equal abilities between the sexes

List of stuff we do include:
* Parental leave (NEEDS TO BE DOUBLE-CHECKED WITH DATA)
